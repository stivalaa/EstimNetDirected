v3.8.8 (15 April 2025)

* New scripts to make table of unique A and B nodes in four-cycles
* New scripts to make boxplots of unique nodes in four-cycles
* New scripts to count number of four-cycles that each node is in
* Added data conversion / preprocessing scripts for empirical examples used in manuscript



v3.8.7 (10 February 2025)

* Found and fixed memory leaks with address sanitizer
* Fixed bug in basic sampler when conditional estimation used
* Implemented correct change statistics for BipartiteAltK4CyclesA and BipartiteAltK4CyclesB terms and restored to parser table
* Implemented new terms BipartiteExaclyOneNeighbourA and BipartiteExactlyOneNeighbourB
* Implemented new terms BipartiteTwoPathExactlyOneNeighbourA and BipartiteTwoPathExactlyOneNeighbourB
* added -m <basemodelnum> option to scripts/estimnetdirectedEstimation2textableMultiModels.sh to start numbering models in table at numbers other than 1
* Added more regression tests for bipartite change statistics


v3.8.6 (18 November 2024)

* Use mclapply() to parallelize four-cycle counting in gof sim plots
* New tests for change stats, comparing to diff of directly computed stats
* Use theme_classic() not default on simulation diagnostic plots so no background or gridlines (as required by some journals)
* More tests for four-cycle computations
* Simulation examples for bipartite networks using BipartiteFourCyclesNodePower

v3.8.5 (27 March 2024)

* Implemented experimental change statistics FourCyclesNodePower, BipartiteFourCyclesNodePowerA, BipartiteFourCyclesNodePowerB
* More test cases, particularly for bipartite change statistics
* Removed incorrect experimental change statistics BipartiteAltK4CyclesA, BipartiteAltK4CyclesB from parser configuration table

v3.8.4 (8 January 2024)

* Experimental statistics BipartiteAltK4CyclesA, BipartiteAltK4CyclesB
* New statistics BipartiteIsolatesA, BipartiteIsolatesB
* New statistics BipartriteNodeMatchBetaA, BipartiteNodeMatchBetaB, BipartiteNodeMatchAlphaA, and BipartiteNodeMatchAlphaB equivalent to b1nodematch and b2nodematch in statnet, defined by Bomiriya et al. (2023)
