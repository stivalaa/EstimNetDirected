Test program for nodal attribute change stats in bipartite network, baseline
is output test program from original BPNet change statistics functions.


Test bpnet_A12000_B4000_sparse_sim870000000.net
is simulated bipartite network with node attribute parameters.
12000 nodes in mode A, 4000 in mode P, with BPNet parameters:

* Simulation started for graph with
 12000 vertices1
* 4000 vertices2
* Parameter Values:
L	      -6
Ksa	  -0.200
Ksp	   0.500
Kca	  -3.000
Kcp	   0.020
* There are 1000000000 proposed graphs.
* Samples are picked up at 1 per 10000000 graphs.
* Accepted 655311 proposed graphs.


Random node attributes from  ../../examples/bipartite/simulation/
(see README in that directory).

bpnet_A12000_B4000_nodepairs.txt was generated with:

../TestChangeStatsBipartite/genRandomNodeNumsBipartite.py  10000 16000 12000 > bpnet_A12000_B4000_nodepairs.txt


and copied from the BPNetChangeStatistics/TestChangeStatsAttrBipartite/
directory where it was generated, so we run with the same input
to do regression tests.
