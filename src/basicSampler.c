 * "Basic" ERGM distribution sampler. It picks a random dyad and toggles
 * the arc.
 *
 * It also optionally does conditional estimation for snowball sampled
 * network. In this case in the MCMC algorithm the ties between nodes
 * in the outermost wave are fixed, as are ties between nodes in the
 * outermost wave and the preceding (second-last) wave. In addition, a
 * tie cannot be added if it would "skip over" a wave (i.e. the
 * absolute difference in wave number between the nodes to add a tie must
 * be at most 1), and a tie cannot be deleted if it is the last remaining
 * tie connected a node to the preceding wave.
 *
 * Note in the case of directed networks the snowball sampling procedure
 * has been assumed to ignore the direction of arcs, so when we consider
 * the above rules here we ignore the direction of the arcs also.

 * Also can optionally do citation ERGM (cERGM) estimation, which is 
 * conditional on the term (time period) of the node. All ties
 * except those from a node in the last time period are fixed.

/*
 * Basic ERGM MCMC sampler. Uniformly at random a dyad i, j is chosen
 * and the arc i->j is toggled, ie added if it does not exist, removed
 * if it does.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   g      - digraph object. Modifed if performMove is true.
 *   n      - number of parameters (length of theta vector and total
 *            number of change statistic functions)
 *   n_attr - number of attribute change stats functions
 *   n_dyadic -number of dyadic covariate change stats funcs
 *   n_attr_interaction - number of attribute interaction change stats funcs
 *   change_stats_funcs - array of pointers to change statistics functions
 *                        length is n-n_attr-n_dyadic-n_attr_interaction
 *   lambda_values      - array of lambda values for change stats funcs
 *                        same length as change_stats_funcs
 *   attr_change_stats_funcs - array of pointers to change statistics functions
 *                             length is n_attr
 *   dyadic_change_stats_funcs - array of pointers to dyadic change stats funcs
 *                             length is n_dyadic
 *   attr_interaction_change_stats_funcs - array of points to attribute
 *                             interaction change stats funcs. Length is
 *                             n_attr_interaction.
 *   attr_indices   - array of n_attr attribute indices (index into g->binattr
 *                    or g->catattr) corresponding to attr_change_stats_funcs
 *                    E.g. for Sender effect on the first binary attribute,
 *                    attr_indices[x] = 0 and attr_change_stats_funcs[x] =
 *                    changeSender
 *   attr_interaction_pair_indices - array of n_attr_interaction attribute
 *                    pair indices (as above but each element is pair of
 *                    such indices) for attribute interaction effects.
 *   theta  - array of n parameter values corresponding to change stats funcs
 *   addChangeStats - (Out) vector of n change stats for add moves
 *                    Allocated by caller.
 *   delChangeStats - (Out) vector of n change stats for delete moves
 *                    Allocated by caller
 *   sampler_m   - Number of proposals (sampling iterations)
 *   performMove - if true, moves are actually performed (digraph updated).
 *                 Otherwise digraph is not actually changed.
 *   useConditionalEstimation - if True do conditional estimation of snowball
 *                              network sample.
 *   forbidReciprocity - if True do not allow reciprocated arcs.
 *   citationERGM      - use cERGM (citation ERGM) estimation conditional
 *                       on term (time period)
 *   allowLoops  - allow self-edges (loops)
 *
 * Return value:
 *   Acceptance rate.
 *
 * The addChangeStats and delChangeStats arrays are of length n corresponding
 * to the theta parameter array and change_stats_funcs change statistics
 * function pointer array. On exit they are set to the sum values of the
 * change statistics for add and delete moves respectively.
 *
 * Note that this sampler does not update the digraph allarcs flat arc list
 * as it does not need to use it at all, so that it remains as it was 
 * and therefore becomes inconsistent with the actual graph when it is modified
 * in this function, so should therefore not be used afterwards.
