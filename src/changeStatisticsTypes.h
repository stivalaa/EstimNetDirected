 * Created: January 2022
 *
 * Typedefs for functions to compute graph change statistics. Each
 * function takes a pointer to a graph struct, and two node numbers
 * i and j and returns the value of the change statistic for adding
 * the edge i -- j or arc i -> j or j <- i (for change statistics where
 * these are all the same). For change statistics specifically for directed
 * graphs, it is the change statistic for adding the arc i -> j.
 *
 * Also takes lambda (decay) parameter which is only used for
 * some statistics ("alternating" statistics).
 *
 * For change statistics dependent on a nodal attribute, there is
 * an additional parameter a which is the index of the attribute
 * to use.
 *
 * On some functions there is additionally a parameter indicating when
 * the change statistic is being computed as part of a delete (rather
 * than add) move, which can be used for some implementations that can
 * be more easily implemented with this information. However in
 * general it is more elegant and simpler to compute the statistic for
 * adding the arc (for delete moves the value returned is just
 * negated, and the change statistic function does not depend on or
 * need to use this information at all).
 *
 * Some of these functions are adapted from the original PNet code by Peng Wang:
 *
 *   Wang P, Robins G, Pattison P. PNet: A program for the simulation and
 *   estimation of exponential random graph models. University of
 *   Melbourne. 2006.
 *
 * And for the definitions of the change statistics:

 *   degree distributions: Exponential random graph (p*) models for
 *   directed social networks. Social Networks, 31(2), 105-117.
